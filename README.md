# HK Airfield Duxford

## Introduction and Breif:

HK Airfield Duxford has been created to provide a user with the option to view and select an experience for flight as a leisure pleasing event. Duxford Airfield is a current tourist attraction in the UK, Duxford and uses the Imperial War Museum and other event ticket hosts like [INTO THE BLUE](www.intotheblue.co.uk) to provide users the option to create this. 
This project site has been created so the Airfield has it's orgin site and can manage customers directly. 

There were three considerations for reason behind this: 

1) A user may be local or know of the airfield in Duxford and just wants to search for a direct site, 
2) the mutli event ticket sites mean that the Aifield is competeing against other provided locations, options and prices and 
3) The Imperial War Museum is a different experience which the customer may or may not wish to include on their experience, albeit a co-lated option.

To gain full understaning of my project objective, I considered being the user and asked:

- What if the customer is a keen petrol head or aircraft flight ehthusaist, is local and knows they just want to fly on this and learn more about the experience infinately, aside the Imperial War Museum or other flight and event experiences in the UK?

- What if they use this facility regularly and need a site to create a profile for simplicity of regularly attending?

- What if they are locally training, for example, and they want to achieve becoming a Private Pilot, and need practice to attain a licence?

Of course, the other sites are avaliable for any other options including family events, gifting experiences and one offs, however this could be a great idea for a very specified user, as described in the instance above. 

In the thesis of considering what I should create, the project requirements laid heavily on the following atrributes:

- Using django to create a site that simply functioned
- A clear reason for the user expectation and experience 
- Relevant planning with user stories and a kanaban - something you could extend mutliple requests in the pre-planning
- The use of a data store - customer details, purchases, something the admin would need to source and review easily
- Clear application of CRUD for the user

Providing an editional site for an already functioning business, that I could see a value for having the site meant that I could focus more narrowly on what the site needed and fulfilling the qualifying attributes.

This also meant that in the real world, I could provide software experience to a real cause and need that would potentially add revnue, customer experience and authenitcity to the company.

## Features

### Planning 

I first outset to create a basic template for an aircraft website through django that funcationally worked and was rid of any errors, then wuld add extar functions and tailor design. 

I created a lucid chart to seewhat files and folders I may need, then wrote basic user stories to understand what I might need to execute this template, then from the user stories added another lucid chart to map out key classes and functions for each step. 

#### Kanban 

#### User Stores 


### Issues and Bugs
1) Inital planning for this caused some teething errors as Gitpod was a migrated workspace. VS Code presented issues as a desktop meaning that backspace (delete) and typing would not produce in either a readme.md or 'file'.py. 
Soultion: Tutor Roman helped me to open this as a browser and it worked a lot better.
2) When creating classes, I had to double check capitals, paraentheses and spacing would not cause any errors and did this through manual eye testing before I set up any automated testing. There were lots on instaces with repeating words and simlar word classes so I had to be very sure. Even seeing a red ( meant I was looking for the issues and noticed I am getting quicker at seeing the lack of a closed ' or wrong lower case.
